"""The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing
N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong
number of arguments,
print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number,
followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible
solution to the problem
One solution per line
